	As my (and likely the) first post of this category and website. I would like to explain what love means to me and my personal goals, if you could call them that, for this column. 

	I love Jolee Michele Maupin, she is a consistent and plentiful source of positivity in my life. That being said, I would like to attempt to approach this section with a certain ambivalence to keep it real. Too often, love and relationships is fantascized to impossible standards and I do not want to promote such culture. Love is too complex to be amazing all the time. I consider love to be an emotional amplifier. Thus, its presence can be both constructive and destructive. What I'm getting at is, this shit is not simple and I will not present it to you as such.

	This is all not to say that Jolee and I are not fantastic on a daily basis and possibly two of the coolest people on this planet; But we are imperfect, and so are our circumstances. Just like 99.9% of the humans on this earth, an imperfect statistic because I really don't know.

	With these principals in mind, we're creating a sincere documentation of our journey together. The product is ultimately for us so we are going to make something that we love. We hope y'all love it too. 

Sincerely, 
	Kenny.
